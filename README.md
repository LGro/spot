# Spike Pattern Optimal Transport

The Python 3 module `spot` implements the Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity described in Grossberger, L., Battaglia, F. and Vinck, M. (2018). Unsupervised clustering of temporal patterns in high-dimensional neuronal ensembles using a novel dissimilarity measure. *PLoS Comput. Biol.*

The dependencies can be installed by running `./env_setup.sh <ENV_NAME>` with the optional argument specifying the target environment (which must be source-able).

To setup the module, run `python setup.py install`.

A jupyter notebook is available in `notebooks/`, along with a demo dataset, showing an example workflow for the SPOTDisClust method.
